# 100-Days-Of-Code
This contains all the code I have done during my 100 Days of Code Challenge using Python.

## Day One
I began learning how to use the print(), input() and len() functions in order to get different outputs on the terminal. I also learned how to use variables to store data.
See Day 1 Test File.py for details.

Using this knowledge, I was able to create a Band Name Generator, which allowed the user to generate a band name based on the city they're from and their pet's name.
See Band Name Generator.py for details
