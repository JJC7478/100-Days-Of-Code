# 100-Days-Of-Code
This contains all the code I have done during my 100 Days of Code Challenge using Python.

## Day 1
I began learning how to use the print(), input() and len() functions in order to get different outputs on the terminal. I also learned about the string data type how to use variables to store data.
See Day-1-Test-File.py for details.

Using this knowledge, I was able to create a Band Name Generator, which allowed the user to generate a band name based on the city they're from and their pet's name.

See Band-Name-Generator.py for details

## Day 2

Expanding upon using the functions I previously learned, I learned about several data types such as integers, floats, and booleans. I also learned how to perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Using this, I was able to convert data from one type to the next, using f-strings and functions such as str(), int(), and float().

This culminated into building a tip calculator. The tip calculator takes in the total bill of an order, the tip percentage, the amount of people to split the bill into, and produces the amount each person should pay towards the bill and the tip. This involves converting string inputs into floats, performing mathematical calculations, and converting them back into strings to get the split result.
